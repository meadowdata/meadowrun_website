# meadowrun.io

The project website for [Meadowrun](https://github.com/meadowdata/meadowrun)

Based on template from [Papaya](https://www.papayatemplates.com) and illustrations from
[Undraw](https://undraw.co)

## Instructions

For local development, run `npm install`, [install the gulp
CLI](https://gulpjs.com/docs/en/getting-started/quick-start/#install-the-gulp-command-line-utility)
then run `gulp`. On Windows, the filesystem watcher is a bit flaky, so you can always
run `gulp html css js images` manually after making edits.
