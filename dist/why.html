            <h2>Why Meadowrun?</h2>

            <p>
                Meadowrun runs your Python code in the cloud, seamlessly. Scale up to a
                bigger machine, or scale out to many machines—once you are ready to
                run your analysis or program on a dataset that doesn’t fit on your
                laptop, Meadowrun helps you do that without hassle and while keeping
                many of the benefits of running locally.
            </p>

            <br>

            <h3>What’s the problem?</h3>

            <p>
                That all sounds great, I hear you say, but don’t we already have
                containers, AWS/Azure/GCP, Kubernetes and Dask/RAPIDS/Spark? Indeed we
                do, but putting those together while ensuring an efficient development
                workflow is no walk in the park.
            </p>

            <p>
                For example, containers are very useful for running on scalable compute
                infrastructure like Kubernetes, but locally you’re more likely to have a
                virtual environment with third-party packages installed, and you’ll
                certainly have some local code you’d like to run. How do you get that in
                the container image efficiently and reproducibly? And if you do get a
                container running, how do you see the logs? If there are any results how
                are they sent back?
            </p>

            <p>
                Another source of complexity is the wide array of options to choose
                from, even within a single cloud provider like AWS. Should you allocate
                an EC2 instance, and if so, should it be an on-demand instance or a spot
                instance? Can you use Lambdas, or maybe Elastic Container Service?
            </p>

            <p>
                Finally, distributed compute clusters like Dask can be a piece of the
                puzzle, but require setup and management, and again the deployment
                problem—how do I get my code and dependencies to the cluster workers—is
                not straightforward to solve.
            </p>

            <br>

            <h3>How does Meadowrun help?</h3>

            <p>
                Meadowrun targets Python analytics users who are familiar with notebooks
                and interactive development, as well as developers who use command line
                tools like pytest. Example use cases are offloading compute-intensive
                analyses or long regression tests.
            </p>

            <p>Our guiding principles for Meadowrun are:</p>

            <ul class="list--indented">
                <li>
                    We want to make Meadowrun feel like you’re running locally, but with
                    all the benefits of the cloud. You shouldn’t have to worry about
                    containers, conda packages, logs and so on, while enjoying virtually
                    unlimited scale and elasticity. The experience we’re striving for is
                    being able to run Python code like it’s SQL.  We’re seeing more data
                    and analytics workloads run on the likes of Snowflake and other
                    cloud data warehouses. They offer a SQL interface which means you
                    don’t have to worry about packages, version conflicts or deploying
                    your code. You also get easy and automatic parallelism and
                    elasticity. We want to offer that same simple experience with the
                    full power and flexibility of Python.
                </li>

                <li>
                    We want to empower users to make decisions that work for them,
                    instead of imposing or restricting choice. Meadowrun targets the
                    main cloud providers, as well as on–prem Kubernetes, and we want to
                    be transparent in the choices it makes—you are in control.
                </li>

                <li>
                    Meadowrun should need very little setup and ongoing maintenance. To
                    that end, we’ve designed Meadowrun to be serverless—there are no
                    cluster managers, services or databases to set up. Pick a cloud
                    provider, run a simple command and you’re good to go.
                </li>

                <li>
                    Last but not least—Meadowrun values your time. Interactive
                    development and short feedback loops are important. Meadowrun
                    doesn’t keep you waiting.
                </li>
            </ul>
